- Excel (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing)

## 🧩 Key Features

- *Total Customers & Churn Rate*  
  Quickly shows total customers, churn percentage, and count of churned customers.

- *Internet & Streaming Service Insights*  
  Visuals showing churn rate by Internet Service type (DSL, Fiber optic, etc.) and Streaming TV subscription.

- *Subscription Analysis*  
  Analyze churn behavior by monthly subscription amount, contract type, and years of contact.

- *Risk Category*  
  Segmentation of customers based on contract and churn risk status.

- *KPI Cards*  
  - Total Yearly Charges
  - Churn Tickets
  - Support Tickets

## 📈 Visualizations Used

- Pie Chart
- Clustered Bar & Column Charts

- Line & Combo Charts
- Slicers for filtering by contract, internet service, and more

## 📁 Dataset

The data includes customer demographics, account information, service subscriptions, and churn status. (Due to confidentiality, raw dataset not included here)

## 🚀 Insights Derived

- Customers with *month-to-month contracts* show the highest churn.
- *Fiber optic* users tend to churn more compared to DSL or non-internet users.
- *Electronic check* users are more likely to churn than those using other payment methods.
- Long-term customers with *2-year contracts* show significantly less churn.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the .pbix file using Power BI Desktop.
2. Use the slicers to filter and explore churn behavior interactively.
3. Analyze KPIs and visual trends to understand key drivers of churn.
